# Global Terrorism Database Analysis

This repository contains code and analysis for my final school project to become a data engineer, exploring the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), a comprehensive dataset of terrorist attacks from around the world. The project uses Python and popular data analysis libraries like pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, squarify, altair, geopandas, and bokeh to clean and preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and build machine learning models to predict various aspects of terrorist attacks.

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to install Python and the following libraries:
- pandas
- NumPy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- squarify
- altair
- geopandas
- bokeh

You can install these libraries using pip, a package manager for Python:
`pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib squarify altair geopandas bokeh`


## Usage

To run the code in this repository, you can clone the repository and open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment. The notebooks are organized by stage of the data analysis pipeline, from data cleaning to model building. You can run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and view the output.

## Data

This project uses two datasets:
- Global Terrorism Database: The GTD is available for download on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd. The dataset contains information on over 200,000 terrorist attacks from around the world. The data is provided in CSV format and includes information on the location, date, type, and severity of the attack, as well as details on the perpetrators and targets.
- Natural Earth Cultural Vectors: This dataset is used to create maps in the project. It can be downloaded from https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/.


## Contributing

This project is open for contributions. If you find any bugs or issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request. We welcome any suggestions or improvements to the code or analysis.

## Credits

This project was created by Jelle Wierenga. The GTD dataset is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland. The Natural Earth Cultural Vectors dataset is provided by Natural Earth.
